<p>The more I use Bias FX 2, the guitar amp sim, the more frustrated I become
with its UI. It's using some awful Chromium based interface that's incredibly
slow. The mere opening sometimes takes a minute, because it has to sign
into the service every time you open it. For every instance you have
in your project. Another annoying thing is the lack of named parameters,
i.e. you can't see, at least in Ableton Live, the name of the parameter
you've mapped, but only a single number.</p>
<p>Ableton Live has been eye-opening with its way of interacting with it and
using it. All the effects and instruments are available from a convenient
bar on the bottom part of the UI. If only all VST plug-ins had that feature
(apparently there are wrappers for some plug-ins).</p>
<h2>Modular Ableton Amp Sim</h2>
<p>The core idea behind MAAS (Modular Ableton Amp Sim) is using a bunch of
standalone effects and instruments, grouping them and manipulating them
in the classic Ableton Live way. Here's a picture of how that looks like.</p>
<p><img class="slika" src="https://dglava.github.io/en/images/maas-1.png" /></p>
<p>All that is possible because of a few features Ableton Live has. Mostly
it's due to the Macro controls. They allow us to map certain parameters
to them and group them conveniently. Chains are also useful and the general
ease of manipulating with options inside effects and instruments.</p>
<p>MAAS (Modular Ableton Amp Sim) consists of an amp, cab and effects.</p>
<h2>Amp</h2>
<p>For our amp, we're using <a href="https://www.neuralampmodeler.com/">Neural Amp Modeler</a>
It is a free software
amp simulator for guitars. You can make profiles of your amps and share
them with others. The quality of amps ranges from okay to "on the same level
as Neural DSP, Amplitube, Guitar Rig and Bias FX". Another reason why NAM
is great for our cause, is because it's lightweight.</p>
<p>Inside an effects rack we have chains, each with an instance of NAM (see number
1). To the Amp macro (see number 2) we can connect the chain selector which
is going to choose the instance of NAM that's active. That alone won't
be enough, so we also need to map the Amp macro to the on/off switch
of the instance. We use the chain's length as a reference for that. For example,
the Bassman 50 amp has its from 0 to 24 (see number 3).</p>
<p>The parameters for Input, Output and Equalizer with its settings are also
mapped to a Macro each (see number 2).</p>
<p>At the end we just have to create Macro variations and save them as 
presets (see number 4). Now we can pick an amp with just 1 click.</p>
<p><a href="https://dglava.github.io/en/images/maas-2.png"><img src="https://dglava.github.io/en/images/maas-2.png" class="slika" /></a></p>
<h2>Cab</h2>
<p>We are using <a href="https://www.igniteamps.com/#nadir">NadIR</a> for our cab sims.
It allows us to load our impulse response files. Together with the
amp part, they form our complete guitar amp. Of course you can use other
programs that can load impulse response files. Ableton Live even has its
own: the Hybrid Reverb. It's only available in the Suite version though.</p>
<p>Just like with the amp, we've got multiple instances of NadIR, each
in its own chain (see number 1). Each chain also has its range and
a macro mapped to it. As with the amp, we want to avoid having multiple
instances active at the same time. The chains are mapped to the Cab
macro (see number 2). Besides that, the parameters for high-pass and
low-pass are also mapped for NadIR.</p>
<p>At the end, just like with the amp part, we create Macro variations
and save them (see number 3).</p>
<p><a href="https://dglava.github.io/en/images/maas-3.png"><img src="https://dglava.github.io/en/images/maas-3.png" class="slika" /></a></p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>Another advantage of the MAAS approach is that all the effects and
their settings are visible on the first glance in the lower bar.
Some useful effects to have there can be equalizers, compressors,
overdrive, reverb and anything you can think of. Mind the placements
of the effect thoughl, since it can have a huge impact on the sound
depending on where you place it (before or after the amps).</p>
<hr>

<p>Those are the basics of MAAS. Of course you can keep adding more
amps, cabs, effects. Unfortunately I can't share my complete preset
due to licensing issues with the amps and IRs. I can however upload
the basic skeleton, which you can then populate with your own files.</p>
